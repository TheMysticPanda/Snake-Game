I am doing a snake game, in which the snake must eat food in order to grow and score points. If however, it touches its own body, or touches the
boundaries of the game, it will die. I have not,yet completed the assignment.
The only part remaining in my assignment, is to make the snake die. I have the code for that in the snakegame.py file too, however, the code does
not work. The code works as per the proposal, and almost 90% of it is complete. I am quite satisfied with the final result so far.

Because the code to implement the game was really long, it was/is really hard to figure out which part of the code would crash the program. The
assignment was much harder than I expected. I am happy that most of my code works perfectly, and that I debugged a lot of the code myself, even though
it was really frustrating at times.

Writing this program has been a great start for me, since it gave me an experience in writing really long programs, and it also helped me understand how
to debug longer peices of code, and how it is very different from writing smaller functions that we did during the homework assignments
thorughout the semester.
